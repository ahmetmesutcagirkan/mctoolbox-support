# mcToolbox - Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 15, 2026**

## Overview
mcToolbox is a network diagnostics application. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection
mcToolbox does **NOT** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All diagnostic results, history, and favorites are stored locally on your device only.

## Network Requests
When you use diagnostic tools (Ping, DNS Lookup, Traceroute, etc.), network requests are sent directly from your device to the target hosts you specify. These requests are necessary for the tools to function and are not routed through our servers.

## Third-Party Services
mcToolbox uses the following third-party APIs solely for diagnostic purposes:
- **Cloudflare DNS** (1.1.1.1) - for DNS lookups
- **ipinfo.io** - for IP geolocation
- **crt.sh** - for certificate transparency lookups
- **RDAP/Whois services** - for domain registration lookups
- **Cloudflare CDN** - for speed test measurements
- **HackerTarget API** - for traceroute and security checks

We do not control the privacy practices of these services. Please refer to their respective privacy policies.

## Local Storage
mcToolbox stores the following data locally on your device using AsyncStorage:
- Diagnostic history and results
- Favorite entries
- App preferences (theme, language)
- Monitoring targets

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share or export it.

## Analytics and Tracking
mcToolbox does **not** use any analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks. No usage data is collected or shared.

## Children's Privacy
mcToolbox is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page with an updated date.
